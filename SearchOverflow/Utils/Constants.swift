/* The Constants struct is the base struct for all constants to use within the app
 * This will be used mostly for UI elements (i.e. colors, fonts, animation times)
 * Its encouraged to typealias your embeded constants
 *      i.e. Added constants for Root view with `struct Root { }`
 *           Should add `typealias Root = Constants.Root`
